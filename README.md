## A very simple iterator for the Ireland Viking Direct invoices (assuming they retain the format).
### Add all the invoices you want to iterate through in an empty "vikingdirect" folder and run the main.py script from any console.
### It will export all the products you've bought and how much money you've spend in two .txt files.
